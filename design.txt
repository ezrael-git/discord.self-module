1) It's advised to run one type of UserBot per file.
Furthermore, the core.py file just serves as a building block for the other files. It imports all the dependencies and files automatically.
Hence, you are not required to download any other files.

2) Each object (manager or worker) represents a Bot object. Think of these extra Manager and Worker classes as a layer. The layer adds the ability for the userbots to work together in a network, efficiently.
The Bot attribute of a class can be accessed through ```classInstance.bot```.

3) The framework uses the latest version of discord.py-self.
discord.py-self is a fork of the popular discord.py wrapper. It allows one to interact with a user account, instead of a bot account.

4) An order must be a link of a raw GitHub file. Some examples of an order are present in /module/orders/.
